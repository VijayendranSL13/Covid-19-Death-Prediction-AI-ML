# Covid-19-Death-Prediction-AI-ML
ABSTRACT

Analyze Covid-19 data and visualize it using Plot library Express in Python. It deals 
with creating dozens of bar charts, line graphs, bubble charts, scatter plots. The graph 
that will be made in this project will be of excellent quality. Envisioning COVID-19 
will primarily be using Plot library Express for this project. The analysis and 
visualization enable people to understand complex scenarios and make predictions 
about the future from the current situation. This analysis summarizes the modeling, 
simulation, and analytics work around the COVID-19 outbreak around the world 
from the perspective of data science and visual analytics. It examines the impact of 
best practices and preventive measures in various sectors and enables outbreaks to 
be managed with available health resources.
